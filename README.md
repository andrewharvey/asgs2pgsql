About
=======

These scripts are designed to load the Australian Bureau of Statistics
[ASGS](http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Statistical+Geography+Standard+(ASGS\)) into a PostgreSQL database. Both the data from the CSV files and spatial
geometries from the SHAPE files are loaded together.

The ASGS consists of Volumes 1-5. Publications 1270.0.55.001 - 1270.0.55.005.
Only Volumes 1-3 have been release and as such these scripts just process 1-3.

Requirements
=======

Debian Dependencies: `gdal-bin, libdbd-pg-perl, postgresql-9.1-postgis,
  libtext-csv-perl, unzip, wget`

The scripts assume you have a PostgreSQL database up and running with a user of
name `abs` and a database owned by `abs` called `abs` which you can connect to
without authentication.

I plan to allow control of the postgres host and port using the PGHOST and
PGPORT environment variables, in a later release.

Running the Scripts
=======

You can set up the user and database with,

    $ sudo su - postgres
    $ createuser --no-createdb --no-createrole --superuser abs
    $ createdb --owner=abs abs
    $ psql --username abs -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql abs
    $ exit

Once that is set up, the rest of the process is as follows.

Currently the download paramaters are hard configured within `01-download-asgs.sh`
these were created using the script `00-make-download-code.sh`. I'm still not sure
if this is the best approach or if the download paramaters should be parsed from
the source HTML file at each call of `01-download-asgs.sh`. For now you should be
able to run,

    ./01-download-asgs.sh
    ./02-unzip-asgs.sh

Which should download and unzip the ASGS Volume 1-5 files.

If this step has been broken due to a change on the abs.gov.au web server,
because the source datasets are CC-BY 2.5 licensed, I host a copy of the results
after the `01-download-asgs.sh` step at http://tianjara.net/data/abs2pgsql/01-ASGS-ZIP/

Next we create the database schema using,

    psql --username abs -f 03-create-asgs-schema.sql abs

Next we load the flat data from the CSV files into PostgreSQL with,

    ./04-load-csv-data.pl < csv2psql.map

The filename/table name and attribute mappings are defined in `csv2pgsql.map`.
This step still needs some extra touches to load the I* references.

Next we load the geometries into these PostgreSQL tables from the SHAPE files
using,

    ./05-load-geom.pl < shp2pgsql.map

Again the schema mapping is controlled by the `shp2pgsql.map` file.

Please note that these scripts are still a work in progress and should be
considered EXPERIMENTAL. Use at your own risk.
