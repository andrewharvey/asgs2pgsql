About
=======
This project is dedicated to providing the Australian Bureau of Statistics
[Australian Statistical Geography Standard](http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Statistical+Geography+Standard+(ASGS\))
(ASGS) in a PostgreSQL database.

This is done by providing scripts to load the source data as provided by
the ABS into PostgreSQL. I also provide a database dump of the loaded data.

The ASGS is published as a combination of non-spatial CSV files and
spatial SHAPE files. Both of these files are used in this loader and
combined together to form my (unofficial) ASGS PostgreSQL schema.

You may also be interested in my corresponding [abs2pgsql loader scripts](https://github.com/andrewharvey/abs2pgsql)
which will (soon) load the ABS 2011 Census of Population and Housing into
PostgreSQL, making use of this ASGS schema to provide the geographic
standard to those statistics.

About the ASGS
=======
The ASGS consists of two parts called the ABS Structures and Non-ABS
Structures [as shown in this diagram](http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/4a256353001af3ed4b2562bb00121564/c453c497aadde71cca2576d300026a38/$FILE/ASGS%20Structure%20and%20Summary.pdf).

The 2011 release of the ASGS consists of Volumes 1-5. Only Volumes 1-3
have been released and as such these scripts just process volumes 1-3.

* Volume 1 - 1270.0.55.001 consists of the Main Structure and Greater Capital City Statistical Areas ([documentation](http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/subscriber.nsf/log?openagent&1270055001_july%202011.pdf&1270.0.55.001&Publication&D3DC26F35A8AF579CA257801000DCD7D&&July%202011&23.12.2010&Latest))
* Volume 2 - 1270.0.55.002 consists of the Indigenous Structure ([documentation](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/subscriber.nsf/log?openagent&1270055002_july%202011.pdf&1270.0.55.002&Publication&FE2D2D707996F20ACA25791000152669&&July%202011&20.09.2011&Previous))
* Volume 3 - 1270.0.55.003 consists of the Non-ABS Structures ([documentation](http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/subscriber.nsf/log?openagent&1270055003_oct%202011.pdf&1270.0.55.003&Publication&469CDA45CE2B94CCCA257937000D966F&&July%202011&31.10.2011&Previous))
* Volume 4 - 1270.0.55.004 consists of the Significant Urban Areas and Section of State/Urban Centres and Localities Structure (SUA, SOS/UCL)
* Volume 5 - 1270.0.55.005 consists of the Remoteness Structure

The ABS Structures (vol 1, 2, 4, 5) will not change until the next Census
in 2016, however the Non-ABS Structures (vol 3) will be updated annually.

For now I load all the volumes into the asgs_2011 schema, although I will
need to rethink this to address the annual updates and census updates.

In the future I may alter the schema with respect to the full codes. For
example SA1's are unique with respect to their 11 digit code. However
that 11 digit code is made up of S/T . SA4 . SA4 . SA3 . SA2 . SA1.
Currently I store a materialised 11 digit SA1 code but really we could
store only the materialised individual codes, and use a function or view
to provide the 11 digit code without materialising it.

Before You Start
=======
Running these scripts is akin to building software from source. If you just
want a copy of the database without needing to "build" it from source skip to
the [last section of this README](#prebuilt_dump).

Requirements
=======
Debian Dependencies: `gdal-bin (>= 1.7.0), libdbd-pg-perl,
  postgresql-9.1-postgis, libtext-csv-perl, unzip, wget`

The scripts assume you have a PostgreSQL database up and running. We leave
authentication to this database your responsibility through the PostgreSQL
environment variables which are described in the next section. I also describe
creating a database in the next section if you don't know how to set one up.

The simplest authentication setup is to allow local unauthenticated access to
your database. You can do this by adding the following example line to
`/etc/postgresql/9.*/main/pg_hba.conf`

    local   abs   abs      trust

This allows the database named `abs` to be accessed by the database user `abs`
without authentication.

You could substitute trust with ident if you create the user `abs` on your
system and run these scripts as that user.

Running the Scripts
===================
Setting up the database environment
-------------------------------------
First you need to set up and export some PG environment variables otherwise the
PostgreSQL defaults will be used. For example,

    export PGHOST=localhost
    export PGDATABASE=abs
    export PGUSER=abs

Refer to the [PostgreSQL documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html)
for details on the environment variables which you can set.

If you don't already have a database and database user set up and you haven't
loaded the PostGIS extensions into that database, then you can set up the user,
database and PostGIS extensions on Debian using (replacing YOUR_DB and YOUR_DB_USER),

    sudo su - postgres
    createuser --no-createdb --no-createrole --superuser YOUR_DB
    createdb --owner=YOUR_DB_USER YOUR_DB
    exit
    # then with your PG* environment variables set load the postgis extensions
    psql -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql

Once that is set up, the rest of the process can be divided into two stages.

Stage 1 involves obtaining a local copy of the source ASGS data, and stage 2
involves loading this data into the PostgreSQL schema.

Stage 1: Downloading the source ASGS data
-------------------------------------
Currently the download parameters are hard configured within `01-download-asgs.sh`
these were created using the script `00-make-download-code.sh`. I'm still not sure
if this is the best approach or if the download parameters should be parsed from
the source HTML file at each call of `01-download-asgs.sh`. For now you should be
able to just run,

    make download

, which should download and unzip the ASGS Volume 1-5 files.

If this step has been broken due to a change on the abs.gov.au web server
(because the source datasets are CC-BY 2.5 licensed) I host a copy of the results
after the `01-download-asgs.sh` step at http://tianjara.net/data/asgs2pgsql/01-ASGS-ZIP/
Just download this directory then run 02-unzip-asgs.sh.

Stage 2: Loading the ASGS data into the database schema
-------------------------------------
This stage assumes you have the 02-ASGS-UNZIP directory from stage 1. With this
just run,

    make

By default the geometries are loaded into PostGIS using the OSM Slippy Map
coordinate system (EPSG:3857) (by using the -use_osm_coordsys option when 
calling ./stage2/05-load-geom.pl from the Makefile). To use the same coordinate
system as the source shape files, remove this option.

Stage 3: Materialised Pyramids of Generalised Geometries (Optional)
-------------------------------------
You can optionally produce materialised pyramid tables of the generalised geometries,

    make generalization_pyramid

Producing PG Dump files
=======
Once everything has been loaded into PostgreSQL using these scripts you can
create a PostgreSQL dump file using,

    pg_dump --format plain --schema "asgs_2011" --no-owner | xz > asgs_2011.sql.xz

<a id="prebuilt_dump"/>
I host a copy of this file at http://tianjara.net/data/asgs2pgsql/. After
creating the abs user and database (with the PostGIS extensions) as described
in the [first chunk of code under the Running the Scripts section](#createdb),
you can load the database dump using,

    xzcat asgs_2011.sql.xz | psql -f -

Because I'm unsure how to install PostGIS into a schema other than public with
PostGIS 1.4, the geometry_columns and spatial_ref_sys tables aren't included in
the DB dump. I believe PostGIS 2.0 makes it easier to install the extension in
another schema, so this issue should be resolved when PostGIS 2.0 is packaged
for Debian and I'm able to load the PostGIS extensions into the asgs_2011
schema.
