About
=======

These scripts are designed to load the Australian Bureau of Statistics
[ASGS](http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/home/Australian+Statistical+Geography+Standard+(ASGS\)) into a PostgreSQL database. Both the data from the CSV files and spatial
geometries from the SHAPE files are loaded together.

The ASGS consists of Volumes 1-5. Publications 1270.0.55.001 - 1270.0.55.005.
Only Volumes 1-3 have been release and as such these scripts just process 1-3.

Requirements
=======

Debian Dependencies: `gdal-bin, libdbd-pg-perl, postgresql-9.1-postgis,
  libtext-csv-perl, unzip, wget`

The scripts assume you have a PostgreSQL database up and running and you have
configured it such that you can connect to the database abs with user abs
without authentication. For example by adding the following line to `/etc/postgresql/9.*/main/pg_hba.conf`

    local   abs   abs      trust

You could substitute trust with ident if you create the user abs on your system
and run these scripts as that user.

Running the Scripts
=======

You can set up the abs user and database with,

    $ sudo su - postgres
    $ createuser --no-createdb --no-createrole --superuser abs
    $ createdb --owner=abs abs
    $ psql --username abs -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/contrib/postgis-1.5/postgis.sql abs
    $ exit

Once that is set up, the rest of the process is as follows.

Currently the download parameters are hard configured within `01-download-asgs.sh`
these were created using the script `00-make-download-code.sh`. I'm still not sure
if this is the best approach or if the download parameters should be parsed from
the source HTML file at each call of `01-download-asgs.sh`. For now you should be
able to run,

    ./01-download-asgs.sh
    ./02-unzip-asgs.sh

Which should download and unzip the ASGS Volume 1-5 files.

If this step has been broken due to a change on the abs.gov.au web server,
because the source datasets are CC-BY 2.5 licensed, I host a copy of the results
after the `01-download-asgs.sh` step at http://tianjara.net/data/asgs2pgsql/01-ASGS-ZIP/

Next we create the database schema and _csv tables using,

    psql --username abs -f 03-create-asgs-csv-schema.sql abs

Next we load the flat data from the CSV files into PostgreSQL with,

    ./04-load-csv-data.pl < csv2psql.map

The filename/table name and attribute mappings are defined in `csv2pgsql.map`.

Next we load geometries into _ogr tables from the SHAPE files using,

    ./05-load-geom.pl < shp2pgsql.map

Again the schema mapping is controlled by the `shp2pgsql.map` file.

By now we have the csv data in the _csv tables and shp file data in _ogr tables.
We then use the 06 script generated from 05 to correct column types in the _ogr
tables so we can then join them using the common key using,

    psql --username abs -f 06-cast-ogr.sql

Next to join the csv and ogr tables together we run,

    psql --username abs -f 07-create-asgs-schema.sql

And finally fixup the geometry_columns table and cleanup the _ogr and _csv
tables leaving just the final joined tables with,

    psql --username abs -f 08-clean-ogr.sql

Producing PG Dump files
=======
Once everything has been loaded into PostgreSQL using these scripts you can
create a PostgreSQL dump file using,

    $ pg_dump --format plain --verbose --schema "asgs_2011" "abs" | gzip > asgs_2011.sql.gz
